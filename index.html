      <p> Web Developer </p>
      
      <p> I'm a Computer Science Major
          at Rartian Valley Community College. The two
          languages that I primarly use are HTML and CSS. I also
          have experience using javascript. I'm also
          in the process of learing python for web development. I'm always trying
        to improve my coding and advance myself. Trying to learn new lanaguages like java
      and C++. I am looking to advance my studies at NJIT and become a better developer. </p>
